					<h2>To start off</h2>
					<p>Let me introduce myself. I am a man who likes computers. But my passions go much further than that. I also enjoy cooking, playing, creating, drawing, imagining, and exploring new things in life. My coding life started not long ago, yet, I strive to be a better coder at all times. One of my primary goals in life is to make the world a better place, make it humans, plants, or animals. I wish to create a world that is not hostile to any. <br>Here is where my journey started. I like to play video games, it is a thing that brings joy to many people. It brought joy to me in the past and still does. However, it was a big step in what I now consider as my passion, using technology. It made me interested in programming and everything related to it.</p>

					<p>My favorite programming language is python, although any other is okay for me. There is just one exception, Java (It is like a hate-hate relation).</p>

					<h3>More about me</h3>

							<h3>Activities I enjoy</h3>
							<p>I enjoy making much more than programming, and although my main passion is programming, I also enjoy many other activities. Such activities include playing video games (especially rocket league and Minecraft), cooking, drawing, designing, solving puzzles, doing some electric work, and educating myself!<br>The list is much lengthier than this. However, these are the most important to me.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
							<h3>Cooking</h3>
							<p>Cooking is one of my favorite things to do. Whenever I'm sad or to get my mind off something, it is my chemistry lab. Testing new flavors and the combination that each of them produces is something that I find as the pinnacle of humanity. I still have a lot to learn in the kitchen, but with every new dish I make, new experiences and sensations inspire me to go even further.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
							<h3>Past experiences</h3>
							<p>In the past, I have worked in many different areas. At the age of sixteen, I worked as an assistant teacher for eduMac. Currently, I am taking part-time jobs as a freelance game developer. One of the most recent projects I've worked on is a gave to help raise COVID-19 awareness. I am also working on other personal projects, such as drunk chess, where next to some friends, we re-imagine chess.</p>

					<h3>Goals in life</h3>
					<p>For me, learning gives life meaning.<br>I want to share that with the world.<br>By using different strategies such as problem-solving, innovating, and being creative, each human being should be allowed to learn and discover. The internet is a great place to learn, but there is more to it. We are really lacking the tools to introduce new people to many new things, things that we haven't even discovered yet. AI is one of my current inspirations, and I want to learn how to master it, share my knowledge with everyone, and make the tools needed for the success of this troubled world.<br>Currently, we are facing many international issues, including global warming(or climate change), politicians that ignore the state of the world, ignorance, trash, pollution, and the list goes on and on. I want to be part of the solution, not the problem. By innovating through science and technology, I want to make the world as we know it changes.</p>
